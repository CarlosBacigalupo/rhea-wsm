This program is designed to generate a Wavelength Scale Model for the Macquarie University single mode spectrograph prototype for asteroseismology and exoplanet discovery. It is named RHEA 

A description of the theoretical and geometrical principles of this code can be found on Carlos Bacigalupo's Honours Thesis upon request at kalumbe@gmail.com and in the comments throughout the code.

This package is written in the Python programming language and requires the following external modules:

- matplotlib
- pylab
- random
- pyfits
- os
- numpy
- scipy
- astLib
- math
- bisect

It also requires several files as input:

- a fits file containing an echelle spectrum of a source (the file used to fit the wavelength scale model)
- a txt file for wavelength calibration, containing a list of wavelengths and pixel positions of a calibration soruce on the CCD (i.e. a frame taken with a Hg lamp as input)
-------AT THIS MOMENT, THE FILE NAMES NEED TO BE HARDCODED IN THE INPUTS FOR THE PROGRAM FUNCTIONS----------------
-------FUTURE VERSIONS WILL LIKELY HAVE THESE AS INPUTS WHEN THE CODE IS RAN--------------------------
